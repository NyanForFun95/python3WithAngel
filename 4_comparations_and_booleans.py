# comparisons always return a boolean

# == is equal as comparer, works with strings and booleans

print(1==1)
print(1=='1')
print(1==2)
print('hola'=='hello')
print(True==True)

# < and > work as expected

# print(1<2)
# print(1>2)
# print(1<1)

# <= and >= allow the equality

# print(1<=1)

# != means different, works with stings and booleans

# print(1!=1)
# print(1!=2)
# print(True!=True)

# booleans have operations too!
